# MyPlacesPOC

## Description
A simple iPhone application that lets you add places on a map and save the places in a database (Realm) so they will persist across sessions. A good place to start if you want to learn about MapKit or mobile database like Realm.

## Usage
Clone the project and run "pod install" from the project directory. After that open "MyPlacesPOC.xcworkspace". If you are using a Simulator, you can pick a location from your Xcode's debug area.

## TODO
* Use Google Maps SDK
* Allow user to navigate to a placemark
